# phonescan

Many wifi-enabled devices send out probe requests to connect to wireless networks faster.
This utility displays wifi-probing devices in the area including mac addresses and time to last probing.
If a device has sent a probe request and then connects to a network it is still monitored by network traffic.

Specify ./phonescan {NetworkInferace} for non-default interface.

Requires libtins.github.io
